                    <h3>Use of Information</h3>

                    <p>Personal Information will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the website user at the time of collection. The user will have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings from Bonvera and/or any third parties. Further, notwithstanding any "opt out" of promotional information by the user, Bonvera reserves the right to contact a customer or Associate regarding account status, changes to the Associate Agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying service and/or the information collected.</p>

                    <p>We use the information that is collected about you for a variety of purposes, such as confirming and fulfilling orders, referrals to service partners, adding you to our e-mail subscription list, providing your name to a Bonvera Associate in connection with potential interest in Bonvera products or the business opportunity. We also use the information in analyzing trends and statistics, enhancing the operation of the website.</p>

                    <p>From time to time you may voluntarily provide Personal Information to complete questionnaires or to participate in contests, polls or personalized assessments. We use this information to improve our products and services. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing information we think would be of particular interest to you concerning things such as new products or website features. But you always have the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited promotional materials from us, and we will make every reasonable effort to honor such requests.</p>

                    <p>Your mentoring sales organization acts as a support network, providing advice, assistance and information to assist you in building and maintaining a successful Bonvera business. Therefore, Bonvera will share Personal Information with your upline sales organization. They have agreed that such information is confidential, and not to share your information with any non-affiliated third parties, and are obligated to observe the intent of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>We work with affiliated businesses we do not control, such as product and service sellers on our website. We share customer information related to any transactions between you and that third party.</p>

                    <p>We may share Personal Information you provide online with other Bonvera-affiliated entities and/or trusted business partners with whom we collaborate. We may employ third party vendors to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include delivering packages, fulfilling orders, e-mail administrative functions, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These vendors will be under bound by contract to use confidential data only for those purposes for which they are hired.</p>

                    <p>Bonvera may disclose Personal Information to a third party in the event that Bonvera sells all or part of its assets to such third party or merges with or is acquired by the third party.</p>

                    <p>Except as stated above or when necessary to share your information with Bonvera agents or business partners for the purposes of performing services for Bonvera, your personal information (name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other information) will not be provided to any third party without your prior consent. We have restricted our agents and business partners from using your personal information in any way other than to provide the services contracted for by Bonvera.</p>

                    <p>We may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, to us or to others. At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information, and we may also disclose information when we believe the law requires it. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.</p>

                    <p>Users may always "opt out" of further promotional contacts at any time. Also, upon request, Bonvera will take reasonable efforts to delete a user's personal information from its database. It may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups and records of deletions.</p>

                    <p>If you are visiting the Website from outside the United States and provide Bonvera with personal information, please note that your personal information will be transferred, stored and processed within the United States.

                    <p>Like many websites, the Bonvera website uses “cookie” technology. A "cookie" is a small data file transferred to your computer's hard drive that allows a website to respond to you as an individual, gathering and remembering information about your preferences.  When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.</p>

                    <h3>Data Security</h3>

                    <p>It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant complete security. We use a variety of current technologies and processes for protection of data. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities.  When you make a purchase on our Web site, your transactional information is transmitted in a safe, encrypted format.</p>

                    <p>Every user that has an account on the Website is responsible for (i) keeping his or her account password confidential and secured, (ii) avoiding unauthorized access to his or her computer; and (iii) keeping the e-mail address associated with that account current (you acknowledge that it is important to keep the e-mail address associated with that account current because although you may be able to log into your Bonvera account using an old e-mail address, you will not receive messages from Bonvera about your orders and inquiries or other matters).</p>

                    <p>You shall be responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your password(s).  You acknowledge that, although the Internet is often a secure environment, sometimes there are interruptions in service or events that are beyond our control, and Bonvera shall not be responsible for any data lost while transmitting or receiving information on the Internet.</p>

                    <h3>Third Party Websites</h3>

                    <p>The Site may provide hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures within a hypertext document that, when clicked, take you to another place within the document, to another document altogether, or to other web sites not controlled by Bonvera. These hyperlinked web sites may contain privacy provisions that are different from those provided herein. Bonvera is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through these web sites or links, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.</p>

                    <h3>Protection of Children's Privacy</h3>
